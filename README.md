# javaDesignPattern
Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a set of proven practices for solving common problems that software developers face while designing applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

# Singleton Pattern 
Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access to it.

# Factory Pattern 
Provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
# Abstract Factory Pattern 
Provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

# Builder Pattern 
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

# Prototype Pattern 
Creates new objects by cloning an existing object rather than creating a new one from scratch.

# Adapter Pattern 
Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

# Bridge Pattern 
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

# Decorator Pattern 
Dynamically adds new behavior to an object by wrapping it with a decorator object.

# Facade Pattern 
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

# Proxy Pattern 
Provides a surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to another object.

These patterns are widely used in Java development and can help make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.
